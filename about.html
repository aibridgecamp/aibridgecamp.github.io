              Jack Fan is a senior at Lexington High School who has enjoyed software development since 6th grade. His
              current prospective majors target the further development of digital supercomputing, AI-based computing,
              and quantum computing in the context of brain modelling and synthesis, and he hopes to hold a part in
              pioneering the new computing age. In recent summers, Jack has contributed to the computational analysis
              portion of a Nature-submitted neuroscience paper from Columbia University and continues to lead LexHack
              LLC, a nonprofit organisation focused on creating a hackathon experience specifically to make AI-based
              solutions to everyday problems more common. He has also recently self-published a quantum computing
              handbook. As a part of the AIBridge team since April, he constantly looks to expand the reach of AI and CS
