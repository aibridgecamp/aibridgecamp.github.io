                    Xin Liu is a Computer Science professor at UC Davis. She is a co-PI
                    and AI cluster lead of the USDA/NSF AI Institute for Next Generation
                    Food Systems (AIFS), a sponsor of AIBridge. Her research focuses on
                    machine learning in food systems and healthcare for humans and
                    animals. Liu, along with Samuel Ren and Houjun Liu, co-created and
                    taught AIBridge at UC Davis in Summer 2022 and continues to broaden
                    its reach.
