### Making Changes: <br />
Each of the html files represents a webpage that can be navigated to via the navbar, the home/landing page is index.html <br /><br />
There is only one CSS file which styles all the tags in the entire website; at the bottom of the css file are some overrides to make the website look better on mobile devices <br /><br />
Most of the pdfs/images are stored in the img folder, this directory can be accessed from any html file with ./img/{name_of_pdf_or_img} <br /><br /><br />
After pushing any changes (directly to main branch is fine), the website will take about 3-5 minutes to update <br /><br />
The html files can also be run locally through any browser, this will update immediately after saving changes and reloading the page
